## Reflections

This project was a great introduction to all of the environmental setup that has to go into creating a unique vr experience. I also liked the attention to performance. It was particularly difficult to loop the animation as the only way to find the option was to click on that file and not in the animation/animator/game object inspector windows. I think it would be great to be able to place furniture from within the application.
